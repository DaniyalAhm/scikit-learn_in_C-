# Machine Learning Algorithms in C++

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms in C++. The aim is to build these algorithms from scratch to understand their inner workings deeply. This project is still in development, and more algorithms will be added over time.

## Implemented Algorithms

1. **Linear Regression**
    - Simple Linear Regression
    - Multivariate Linear Regression

2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
    - KNN for Classification
    - KNN for Regression

3. **Naive Bayes**
    - Multinomial Naive Bayes
    - Binary Naive Bayes
    

## Dependencies

- [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/GettingStarted.html) - A C++ template library for linear algebra.
- [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) - A set of libraries for C++ that provides support for tasks and structures such as linear algebra, pseudorandom number generation, multithreading, image processing, regular expressions, and unit testing.

## Installation

1. **Install Eigen**

    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev
    ```

2. **Install Boost**

    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
    ```

## Usage

### Linear Regression
