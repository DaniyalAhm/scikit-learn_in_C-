# Scikit-learn from Scratch in C++

## Project Overview
This project aims to implement core machine learning algorithms from scratch using C++. The goal is to understand the underlying mathematics and algorithms that power popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn. The project is currently in development.

## Features
- **Linear Regression**
  - Simple and multivariate linear regression.
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE) evaluation.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
  - KNN for classification and regression.
  - Support for multiple distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski, Cosine Similarity).

## Requirements
- C++11 or higher
- [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/) library for linear algebra operations
- CMake for building the project

## This Project is still in Development
